# OOPs Lab

This repository contains a compilation of lab programs completed during the third semester in the OOPs (Object Oriented Programming) Lab.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a reference for lab exercises undertaken during the third semester. It's intended to provide insights into problem-solving approaches and solutions implemented during the lab sessions.

## Notes
- Programs listed here are based on personal attempts during lab sessions. They may not cover all programs outlined in the lab manual and might include additional exercises attempted that the lab instructor gave.
- The solutions presented here may not represent the most optimal or cleanest implementations. There is always room for improvement, and better solutions may exist.
- Hope that JavaFX is removed from the curriculum. It's a pain to work with. If it is still there, I hope you have a better experience with it than I did. Use ZuluJDK for Java and ZuluFX for JavaFX. It's a better alternative to Oracle's JDK.
